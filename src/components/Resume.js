                            Throughout my educational journey, I have developed skills in graphic design, videography, and editing. My interest in web development continues to grow along with my skills in graphic design, videography, and editing. I believe that with this combined, I can create a website that not only functions well technically but also has an attractive visual aesthetic.
                            I believe that with my passion, I can achieve many extraordinary things in the world of technology and visual arts.
